Producers

Graham Sutton & Sea Power

[Verse 1]
Well, it wasn't good, but it was okay
Now I think I'll leave by the fire escape
The night is almost over now
I don't want the day to find out how

We're up against it

[Chorus]
Oh, whatcha here for, are you here for again?
Oh, whatcha here for, are you here for again?
To rub against it

[Verse 2]
Deserted streets and neural networks lead
Me home to you, you home to me
It's obvious, yeah, it's oh so clear
It's beautiful when you are near
We're up against it

[Chorus]
So whatcha here for, arе you here for again?
So whatcha herе for, are you here for again?
Oh, whatcha here for, are you here for again?
Oh, whatcha here for, are you here for again?
Oh, oh

[Outro]
To rub against it
We're up against it
We're up against it
We're up against it
